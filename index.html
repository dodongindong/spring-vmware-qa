                    Contructor injection is preferred because it allows for easier unit testing. If only one constructor is available it will be used to inject dependencies without the need of @Autowired annotation.

                    As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on such a constructor is no longer necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor to begin with.

                    <p style="color: red">Selected Answer: BCE</p>
                    @Qualifier annotation is used to specify a bean id when injecting. @Qualifier can be used both on fields and method parameters. If it is a field injection the name of the field can qualify the bean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The very first injection was foo1 setter injection (@5293), after that foo3 and foo2 (the upper definition in class gets injected first, so in my code, I had defined the order of injections as follows: B, E, C, but setter injection (C) happens first, then B and E). There is no problem with the same "foo" variable name of two different beans in one class (C and B injections), as the variable scopes are different, and in practice, in case C the foo1 bean can be used and processed immediately (first) or reassigned to another variable name, therefore with this injection configuration the injection of all three beans foo1, foo2, foo3 is possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Explanation of my previous comment/answer:</p>

                    <p>Spring injection happens first by type definition, but the type is the same in all answers, so it looks for @Primary annotation, which is not found, then for @Qualifier annotations, and the last lookup, if @Qualifier was not found, is the resolution by bean name. If not successful, after all, the exception is thrown.</p>

                    <p>In my demo app, when I run B,E,C, my break point first stops at setter method setFoo where I can see in debug already injected beans:</p>
                    <p>Foo@5293 - foo1 - C</p>
                    <p>Foo@5297 - foo3 - B</p>
                    <p>Foo@5298 - foo2 - E</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A and D is not correct at all. I defined 3 beans definitions with those ids and in my service class used setter injection or simple Foo foo definition of Autowired-> gives error:</p>

                    <p>Could not autowire. There is more than one bean of 'Foo' type.</p>
                    <p>Beans:</p>
                    <p>foo1   (MyConfiguration.java), foo2   (MyConfiguration.java), foo3   (MyConfiguration.java) </p>

                    <p>Working cases per single case: B,C,E,F</p>
                    <p>But not works all 4 together, C and F say the setFoo method name is already defined.</p>


                    <p>So B, E, F will work -> but will inject only 2 beans, foo3 and foo2 -> foo2 in 2 places, but is at the end the same bean defined once through setter injection and second time through autowired filed injection.</p>

                    <p>Or B, E, C will work ->  will inject foo1, foo2, foo3</p>

                    <p>So the only correct answer to inject beans foo1,foo2,foo3 with working program is B, E, C.</p>

                    <p>A and B, per Autowired documentation.</p>

                    <p>Autowired Fields</p>
                    <p>Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any config methods are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public.</p>
                    
                    <p>Autowired Methods</p>
                    <p>Config methods may have an arbitrary name and any number of arguments; each of those arguments will be autowired with a matching bean in the Spring container. Bean property setter methods are effectively just a special case of such a general config method. Such config methods do not have to be public.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Not sure about A,  because @Autowired fields are injected before any config methods (@Bean, @Component, @Configuration, etc..) are invoked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    E is not correct
                    <p>Note that actual injection is performed through a BeanPostProcessor which in turn means that you cannot use @Autowired to inject references into BeanPostProcessor or BeanFactoryPostProcessor types. Please consult the javadoc for the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor class (which, by default, checks for the presence of this annotation).
